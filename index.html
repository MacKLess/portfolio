                  <img class="feat" src="img/cherry.png" alt="Japan: Cherry Blossom Dreams Webpage"  height="240px" width="300px"/>Japan: Cherry Blossom Dreams was created to promote the various benefits of vacationing in Japan during the Cherry Blossom season.

                  <br>Wiki Clone is an attempt to recreate the Wikipedia mainpage on 8/3/17. The page changes everyday, so the cloned page and the Wikipedia link will have content changes (text, images, and links), but you can see several elements that were recreated in this version. Co-created with <em>E. Belmonti</em> using Git, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

Designed as one of three potential promotional angles using Git branch and merge functions, the site boasts a Gabber musical background and a video about this type of electronic music, a subgenre of hardcore techno. Designed in collaboration with <em>R. Furry</em> using Git, HTML, and CSS.

            <p class="me">I have a background in biology and comparative literature. Over my career, I've worn a number of hats -from paralegal to tidepool educator to program coordinator at a private university. Despite my diverse curiousity in both the arts and hard sciences, I keep finding myself drawn back to one of my earliest childhood loves: programming.
