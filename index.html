        <img class="mack" src="img/LinkedInCrop.jpg" alt="Profile of Author" height="12%" width="12%"/>
        <p class="me">I have a background in biology and english and comparative literature. My work history has spanned everything from paralegal and tidepool educator. Despite my various travels and seachange in life, I keep finding myself drawn back to one of my earliest childhood loves: programming. When not sitting in front of a computer screen, I can be found volunteering at the Seattle Aquarium, on the surface or below the local waters of Puget Sound, drinking excessive amounts of tea, working on my vintage motorcycle, or just trying to breath in boxing classes.
