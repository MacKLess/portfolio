            <h2>Current Projects</h2>
            <p>
              The following are my previous projects, for your viewing convenience. Author recommendations are indicated by the green text. Enjoy!
            </p>
              <ul>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/MacKLess/our-wiki.git">Rebuilt Wiki Page:</a> (Cowriter: E.Belmonti)
                Saving the best for last, Belmonti and I used Bootstrap, CSS, HTML, and Git to recreate a Wikipedia page. We made free use of columns, rows, more div classes than ever before, and our first experience building tabs. The end result is not identical to the modelled page, but gratifyingly similar. We hope you enjoy it!</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/MacKLess/vacation.git">Cherry Blossom Dreaming:</a> (Cowriter: E.Belmonti)
                An enjoyable page codesigned with Belmonti extolling the virtues of vacationing in Japan during Cherry Blossom season. It worked --now I want to go! In this site, we heavily utilized Bootstrap, CSS, HTML and Git.</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/MacKLess/week-in-review.git">Week in Review:</a> (Cowriter: E.Belmonti)
                Elrey Belmonti and I created this webpage using text supplied by Epicodus and using our first front-end framework, Bootstrap. What a revelation! We thoroughly enjoyed exploring the different possibilities with the templates and the speed with which we accomplished polished effects with considerable ease and speed compared with the limited use of only css and html. Consider me a convert.</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/MacKLess/adoptions.git">Warm Hearted Home Needed:</a> (Cowriter: E.Zakrewski)
                This was the final page I worked on with Zakrewski and it was further practice in columns, images, background effects using Git, HTML, and CSS. The best part this page, in my opinion, is the animal selection. I'm very proud of "Neville the Puggle."</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/MacKLess/renovations.git">Kitchen Renovations:</a> (Cowriter: E.Zakrewski)
                Was created (again with Zakrewski) with Git, HTML, and CSS to practice using columns. Our subject was kitchen renovations with a column each for: before, during, and after.</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/MacKLess/gwar.git">Gwe are Gwar:</a> (Cowriter: E.Zakrewski)
                Fan website highlighting art rock band Gwar in which we practiced floats using only Git, CSS, and HTML.</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/MacKLess/blogging.git">Guilty Pleasures:</a> (Cowriter: E.Zakrewski)
                Exercise focusing on styling with selectors, designed with Zakrewski. This was our first use of an "About Me" section.</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/MacKLess/boring-lecture.git">State Bored Exams:</a> (Cowriter: E.Zakrewski)
                Another styling with classes website collaboration with Zakrzewski. Updated later in the day with div classes.</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/MacKLess/cupcake-shop.git">Cupcake Shack:</a> (Cowriter: E.Zakrewski)
                Three page webpage created with Erik Zakrzewski for our "Cupcake Shack." Fun experiment with photos, background colors, and styling with classes.</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/MacKLess/last-resort.git">Last Resort:</a> (Cowriter: R.Furry)
                Fun project with codeveloper Furry, incorporating music, linked media, photos, and branching versions of a lovely little dystopic resort off the coast of Japan. The last vacation you'll ever want to take!</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/MacKLess/fluffy-thorfeld-adventures.git">Adventures of Fluffy and Thorfeld:</a> (Cowriter: R.Furry)
                Co-written with Rafael Furry, this was my first implementation of a README page as well as linked/nested pages, detailing the adventure of two of my pets: Fluffy the Python and Thorfeld the Bulldog.</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/MacKLess/my-first-webpage.git">My First Webpage:</a> (Cowriter: K.Kulha)
                This project involved two webpages co-modified with Kulha (basic webpage forms were laid out by Epicodus) and was my first experience of adding image files. This was also the beginning of a trend to include pictures of my bulldog. Yeah -I'm that person.</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/MacKLess/cookie-recipe.git">Cookie Recipe:</a> (Cowriter: K.Kulha)
                This project was formatting a recipe (original contributor: ellenklehman) with basic html tags (p, h, ul, li, and ol). Please note: I have not product tested the actual cookie recipe. Attempt at your own risk!</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/MacKLess/goodbye.git">Goodbye:</a> (Cowriter: K.Kulha)
                Of course, it's awkward to say hello, without eventually being able to take your leave. This page is a shorter list of farewells with an oddly emo tone. Enjoy! Also cowrote with Kulha.</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/MacKLess/hello-world.git">Hello World:</a> (Cowriter: K.Kulha)
                This was my first webpage I cowrote with Kristen Kulha listing forms of greeting in various languages around the world. Thrilling stuff!</li>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="img/LinkedInCrop.jpg" alt="Profile of Author" height="15%" width="15%"/>
        <h3>I have a background in biology and english and comparative literature. My work history has spanned everything from paralegal and tidepool educator. Despite my various travels and seachange in life, I keep finding myself drawn back to one of my earliest childhood loves: programming. When not sitting in front of a computer screen, I can be found volunteering at the Seattle Aquarium, on the surface or below the local waters of Puget Sound, drinking excessive amounts of tea, working on my vintage motorcycle, or just trying to breath in boxing classes.
