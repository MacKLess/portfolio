            <h2>Current Projects</h2>
            <p>
              The following are my previous projects, for your viewing convenience. Author recommendations are indicated by the green text. Enjoy!
            </p>
              <ul>
                <li>hello-world
                This was my first webpage I cowrote with Kristen Kulha listing forms of greeting in various languages around the world. Thrilling stuff!</li>
                <li>goodbye
                Of course, it's awkward to say hello, without eventually being able to take your leave. This page is a shorter list of farewells with an oddly emo tone. Enjoy! Also cowrote with Kulha.</li>
                <li>cookie-recipe
                This project was formatting a recipe (original contributor: ellenklehman) with basic html tags (p, h, ul, li, and ol). Please note: I have not product tested the actual cookie recipe. Attempt at your own risk!</li>
                <li>my-first-webpage
                This project involved two webpages co-modified with Kulha (basic webpage forms were laid out by Epicodus) and was my first experience of adding image files. This was also the beginning of a trend to include pictures of my bulldog. Yeah -I'm that person.</li>
                <li>fluffy-thorfeld-adventures
                Co-written with Rafael Furry, this was my first implementation of a README page as well as linked/nested pages, detailing the adventure of two of my pets: Fluffy the Python and Thorfeld the Bulldog.</li>
                <li>last-resort
                Fun project with codeveloper Furry, incorporating music, linked media, photos, and branching versions of a lovely little dystopic resort off the coast of Japan. The last vacation you'll ever want to take!</li>
                <li>cupcake-shop
                Three page webpage created with Erik Zakrzewski for our "Cupcake Shack." Fun experiment with photos, background colors, and styling with classes.</li>
                <li>boring-lecture
                Another styling with classes website collaboration with Zakrzewski. Updated later in the day with div classes.</li>
                <li>blogging
                Exercise focusing on styling with selectors, designed with Zakrewski. This was our first use of an "About Me" section.</li>
                <li>gwar
                Zakrewski and I came up with the rather amusingly titled "Gwe are Gwar" fan website in which we practiced floats using only Git, CSS, and HTML.</li>
                <li>renovations
                Was created (again with Zakrewski) with Git, HTML, and CSS to practice using columns. Our subject was kitchen renovations with a column each for: before, during, and after.</li>
                <li>adoptions
                This was the final page I worked on with Zakrewski and it was further practice in columns, images, background effects using Git, HTML, and CSS. The best part this page, in my opinion, is the animal selection. I'm very proud of "Neville the Puggle."</li>
                <li>week-in-review
                Elrey Belmonti and I created this webpage using text supplied by Epicodus and using our first front-end framework, Bootstrap. What a revelation! We thoroughly enjoyed exploring the different possibilities with the templates and the speed with which we accomplished polished effects with considerable ease and speed compared with the limited use of only css and html. Consider me a convert.</li>
                <li>vacation
                An enjoyable page codesigned with Belmonti extolling the virtues of vacationing in Japan during Cherry Blossom season. It worked --now I want to go! In this site, we heavily utilized Bootstrap, CSS, HTML and Git.</li>
                <li>our-wiki
                Saving the best for last, Belmonti and I used Bootstrap, CSS, HTML, and Git to recreate a Wikipedia page. We made free use of columns, rows, more div classes than ever before, and our first experience building tabs. The end result is not identical to the modelled page, but gratifyingly similar. We hope you enjoy it!</li>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="img/LinkedInCrop.jpg" alt="Profile of Author" height="15%" width="15%"/>
        <h3>I have a background in biology and english and comparative literature. My work history has spanned everything from paralegal and tidepool educator. Despite my various travels and seachange in life, I keep finding myself drawn back to one of my earliest childhood loves: programming. When not sitting in front of a computer screen, I can be found volunteering at the Seattle Aquarium, on the surface or below the local waters of Puget Sound, drinking excessive amounts of tea, working on my vintage motorcycle, or just trying to breath in boxing classes.
